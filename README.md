- The data was scraped from a public API and is being hoseted on mLab. I am storing the full data and favorites in the db.
- I also scraped all of the images and included them in the public folder for faster loading
- Every API call is to my own API. 
- Redux is used for supplying full data and favorites to several components, but not all. All API actions are using Redux.
